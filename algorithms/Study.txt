Abstract Data Structures: A description of operations and properties that define a new type

Stack: A LIFO Collection
 Operations: Push, Pop, Peek, IsEmpty, Size

Queue: A FIFO Collection
 Operations: Enqueue, Dequeue, IsEmpty, Size

Deque: Double-ended queue.
 Operations: AddFront, RemoveFront, AddRear, RemoveRear, IsEmpty, Size

Unordered List: An unordered collection
 Operations: Add(item)/Append(item), Remove(item), Search(item), Size, IsEmpty

Ordered List: An ordered collection

Tree:

Heap:

Data Structure: A concrete implementation of some type
 Linked List: Helps implement ordered and unordered lists
 Tree: Is both an ADT and a data structure

Recursion:
