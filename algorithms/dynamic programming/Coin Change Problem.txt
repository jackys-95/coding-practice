Coin Change Problems
-Given a set of coins of certain denominations, how can we construct a certain cash amount using the fewest coins?

-Let C[p] be the optimal solution (opt) for p cents.
C[p] = 1 + C[p - x] (x is value of first coin in opt)
-First coin implies that order matters? Or eventually the sub-problems will just compute to the same end possibly.
-Convince yourself that this is true.
-1 + because you obviously need one coin.

Let's do an example.
d = {1, 5, 10, 25}
p = 7
7 = 1 + 1 + 5
C[7] = 3
C[7] = 1 + C[7-1] = 1 + C[6]

C[6] sub problem.
C[6] = 1 + C[6-x]
6 = 1 + 5, x = 1
C[6] = 1 + C[6-1]
C[6] = 1 + C[5]

C[5] sub problem.
5 = 5
C[5] = 1

Bubble up.

C[6] Bubble up.
C[6] = 1 + C[5]
C[6] = 1 + 1
     = 2

C[7] = 1 + C[6]
     = 1 + 2
     = 3

Generalize this with a recurrence relation?

C[p] = { min_(i:d_i<=p){C[p - d_i] + 1} if p > 0
                            0           if p = 0 }
